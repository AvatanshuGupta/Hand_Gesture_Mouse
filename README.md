# 🖐️ Hand Gesture Mouse Control using MediaPipe, OpenCV & PyAutoGUI

This project enables real-time control of the mouse pointer using hand gestures captured via a webcam. It utilizes **MediaPipe** for hand tracking, **OpenCV** for image processing, and **PyAutoGUI** for controlling mouse events.

## 🚀 Features

- Control the mouse pointer with your index finger.
- Click by pinching your index finger and thumb.
- Smooth cursor movement.
- Cooldown mechanism to prevent multiple clicks.
